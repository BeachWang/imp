\[Technical report (coming soon)\]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Demo](https://xmbot,net/imp/)\]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/MILVLG/imp-v1-3b/)\]


The Imp project aims to provide a family of  a strong multimodal `small` language models (MSLMs). Our `imp-v1-3b` is a strong MSLM with only **3B** parameters, which is build upon a small yet powerful SLM [Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) (2.7B) and a powerful visual encoder [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384) (0.4B), and trained on the [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) training set.  

As shown in the Table below, `imp-v1-3b` significantly outperforms the counterparts of similar model sizes, and even achieves slightly better performance than the strong LLaVA-7B model on various multimodal benchmarks. 

We release the model weights a running example of `imp-v1-3b` on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/MILVLG/imp-v1-3b/). Technical report and training and evaluation code will be released soon. We will persistently improve our model and release the next versions to further improve model performance :)

## Model evaluation
We conduct evaluation on 9 commonly-used benchmarks, including 5 academic VQA benchmarks and 4 popular MLLM benchmarks, to compare our Imp model with LLaVA (7B) and existing MSLMs of similar model sizes.

## About us
This project is maintained by the [MILVLG](https://github.com/MILVLG)@Hangzhou Dianzi University (HDU) led by Prof. Zhou Yu and Jun Yu, and is mainly developed by Zhenwei Shao and Xuecheng Ouyang. We hope our model may serve as a strong baseline to inspire future research on MSLM, as well as its derivative applications on mobile devices and robots.
