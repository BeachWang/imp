\[Technical report (coming soon)\]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Demo](https://xmbot.net/imp/)\]&nbsp;&nbsp;[[Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/MILVLG/imp-v1-3b/)\]


This repository contains the official training/evaluation code of the Imp project, which aims to provide a family of  a strong multimodal small language models (MSLMs). Our `imp-v1-3b` is a strong MSLM with only **3B** parameters, which is build upon a small yet powerful SLM [Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) (2.7B) and a powerful visual encoder [SigLIP](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384) (0.4B), and trained on the [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA) training set.  

As shown in the [Evaluation](#evaluation), `imp-v1-3b` significantly outperforms the counterparts of similar model sizes, and even achieves slightly better performance than the strong LLaVA-7B model on various multimodal benchmarks. 

We also release the model weights a running example of `imp-v1-3b` on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/MILVLG/imp-v1-3b/). Technical report will be released soon. We will persistently improve our model and release the next versions to further improve model performance :)

## Updates
- February 7, 2024: Training and evaluation codes of `imp-v1-3b` are released.

## Prerequisites

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the folder 
``` shell
git clone https://github.com/MILVLG/imp.git
cd imp
```
2. Install Package
We recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to create a new environment for the project, and install the requirements with the following commands:
``` shell
conda create -n imp python=3.10 -y
conda activate imp
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install flash-attn==2.4.2 --no-build-isolation
```
3. (Optional) Manually download the pretrained model repositories, i.e., [google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384](https://huggingface.co/google/siglip-so400m-patch14-384) and [microsoft/phi-2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) to your local directories and modify the corresponding paths in training and evaluation scripts.

## Training
The training pipeline and datasets of `imp-v1-3b` are directly inherited from [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA). The training  
- *Multimodal pretraining*: train a projector on a subset of âˆ¼558K image-text pairs to connect a frozen pretrained vision encoder and a frozen LLM.
- *Multimodal instruction tuning*: fine-tune the projector and LoRA in the LLM with multimodal instruction data and VQA-formatted data to empower the MLSM the ability of multimodal instruction following.

Imp is trained on 8 A100 (40G) GPUs. You can reduce the `per_device_train_batch_size` and increase the `gradient_accumulation_steps` to match your resources. .But always keep the global batch size the same: `global_batch_size ` = `per_device_train_batch_size` $`\times`$ `gradient_accumulation_steps` $`\times`$ `num_gpus`.

<summary>Training scripts </summary>

### Stage-1: Multimodal pretraining

Please download the caption annotations `blip_laion_cc_sbu_558k.json` and images from [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Pretrain). Move the downloaded files to the `./datasets` folder, with image folder unzipped and renamed to `pretrain_images`. Then run the following command to start the training process:

``` shell
bash scripts/pretrain.sh
```

After that, a checkpoint of the multimodal projector will be stored in `./checkpoints/imp-v1-3b-pretrain`.

### Stage-2: Multimodal instruction tuning

Please download the annotation file of the mixed instruction tuning data [llava_v1_5_mix665k.json](https://huggingface.co/datasets/liuhaotian/LLaVA-Instruct-150K/blob/main/llava_v1_5_mix665k.json), and download the images from constituting datasets:

- COCO: [train2017](http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip)
- GQA: [images](https://downloads.cs.stanford.edu/nlp/data/gqa/images.zip)
- OCR-VQA: [download script](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1_GYPY5UkUy7HIcR0zq3ZCFgeZN7BAfm_?usp=sharing), **save all files as `.jpg`**
- TextVQA: [train_val_images](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/textvqa/images/train_val_images.zip)
- VisualGenome: [part1](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/images.zip), [part2](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/rak248/VG_100K_2/images2.zip)

After downloading all of them, organize the data as follows:

```
datasets
â”œâ”€â”€ llava_v1_5_mix665k.json
â””â”€â”€ finetune_images
    â”œâ”€â”€ coco
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train2017
    â”œâ”€â”€ gqa
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
    â”œâ”€â”€ ocr_vqa
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ images
    â”œâ”€â”€ textvqa
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ train_images
    â””â”€â”€ vg
        â”œâ”€â”€ VG_100K
        â””â”€â”€ VG_100K_2
```

Then start the training process with the following command:

``` shell
bash scripts/finetune_lora.sh
# bash scripts/finetune.sh # fully finetuning is not recommended
```
You will get a trained model (a LoRA diff if you use `finetune_lora.sh`) under `./checkpoints/` when the training is done.

## Evaluation
We follow the evaluation of [LLaVA-v1.5](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/tree/main) and conduct experiments on 9 commonly-used benchmarks, including 5 academic VQA benchmarks and 4 popular MLLM benchmarks. All evaluation scripts are placed in the `scripts/eval` folder. 

Before preparing task-specific data, you should download [eval.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1atZSBBrAX54yYpxtVVW33zFvcnaHeFPy/view?usp=sharing) and extract to `./playground/data/eval`. For more specific instructions, please refer to [LLaVA's Evaluation.md](https://github.com/haotian-liu/LLaVA/blob/main/docs/Evaluation.md). 

It is supported to evaluate your own trained checkpoints or our official released `imp-v1-3b` at [Huggingface Hub](https://huggingface.co/MILVLG/imp-v1-3b/). 

See [Evaluation.md](./docs/Evaluation.md).

Using the script in `Evaluation.md`, we obtain our Imp model's accuracies in the following table, Compare with LLaVA (7B) and existing MSLMs of similar model sizes.
